/** Base class for the activiti test cases.
 * 
 * The main reason not to use our own test support classes is that we need to 
 * run our test suite with various configurations, e.g. with and without spring,
 * standalone or on a server etc.  Those requirements create some complications 
 * so we think it's best to use a separate base class.  That way it is much easier 
 * for us to maintain our own codebase and at the same time provide stability 
 * on the test support classes that we offer as part of our api (in org.activiti.engine.test).
